1)AIM: 
 
The aim of this project is to design and implement an Arduino-based earthquake detector using an ADXL335 accelerometer, LCD display, buzzer, and LED. The system detects unusual ground vibra ons and provides real- me alerts through visual and audio signals, enhancing early warning and safety measures during seismic ac vity. 
 
 
2)COMPONENTS USED : 
 	Hardware (Simulated):  
•	Arduino Uno  
•	ADXL335 Sensor 
•	16x2 LCD Display 
•	Poten ometer (10k) 
•	LED  
•	Resistors (220 ohm × 3)  
•	Jumper Wires 
•buzzer 
•bread board 
 So ware: • Tinkercad Circuits (for simula on) 
 
 
3) Circuit Descrip on: 
The ADXL335 accelerometer con nuously monitors vibra ons along the X, Y, and Z axes. 
It sends analog voltage signals to the Arduino Uno corresponding to accelera on in each direc on. The Arduino processes these values and compares them to calibrated baseline readings. 
When significant changes (indica ve of tremors) are detected: 
•	The buzzer is turned ON 
•	The LED is turned ON 
•	The LCD displays "Earthquake ALERT" 
When no unusual movement is detected: 
•	The buzzer remains OFF 
•	The LED remains OFF 
•	The LCD shows real- me X, Y, Z axis values 
This setup forms a simple early-warning system for earthquakes, enhancing safety and awareness in sensi ve areas.

} 
 
void loop() {   int xVal = analogRead(X_PIN);   int yVal = analogRead(Y_PIN);   int zVal = analogRead(Z_PIN);   int dx = xSample - xVal;   int dy = ySample - yVal;   int dz = zSample - zVal; 
 
  bool isQuake = (     dx < MIN_CHANGE || dx > MAX_CHANGE ||     dy < MIN_CHANGE || dy > MAX_CHANGE ||     dz < MIN_CHANGE || dz > MAX_CHANGE 
  ); 
 
  if (isQuake && alertFlag == 0) {     startTime = millis();     alertFlag = 1; 
  } 
 
  if (alertFlag && millis() - startTime > BUZZ_DURATION) {     alertFlag = 0; 
  }

    lcd.print("Earthquake ALERT");

  Serial.print("X: "); Serial.print(dx); 
  Serial.print(" Y: "); Serial.print(dy); 
  Serial.print(" Z: "); Serial.println(dz);

5. Simula on , Demo & Github links: 
This project was built and tested using Tinkercad Circuits, where: 
•	The ADXL335 accelerometer was simulated using adjustable analog inputs to mimic ground vibra ons 
•	The LED, buzzer, and LCD func oned according to the detected changes in accelera on 
•	Vibra on thresholds were tested by varying X, Y, and Z values to trigger the "Earthquake ALERT" on the LCD and ac vate the buzzer and LED accordingly

6)Results: 
•	When vibra on is detected, the LED and buzzer turn ON, and the LCD displays "Earthquake 
ALERT" 
•	When no vibra on is detected, the LED and buzzer remain OFF, and the LCD shows real- me X, Y, Z axis values 
•	The system mimics a real- me earthquake detec on and alert system, and it performed as expected during Tinkercad simula on 
 
 
 
7) Conclusion 
This project demonstrates the use of accelerometer sensors and microcontrollers for seismic ac vity detec on and aler ng. 
It is highly applicable in: 
•	Early warning systems for earthquake-prone regions 
•	Home and building safety monitoring 
•	Industrial equipment protec on 
It can be extended in real-world environments by replacing the LED and buzzer with relays to trigger sirens, emergency ligh ng, or even automated shutdown systems for cri cal infrastructure.
